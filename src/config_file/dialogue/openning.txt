You : Wow, this place looks dangerous.
I hope I'll be okay. |Stranger : Hey, traveler! You must be new here.
Take this armor,
it's dangerous around these parts. |You : Thanks, I'll be careful. |Stranger : You're welcome! Head to the blacksmith nearby.
My friend there will give you a weapon to defend yourself.
Good luck!
